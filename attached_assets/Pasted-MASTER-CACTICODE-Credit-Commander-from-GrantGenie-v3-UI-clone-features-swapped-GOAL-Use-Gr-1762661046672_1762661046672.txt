MASTER CACTICODE — “Credit Commander” from GrantGenie v3 (UI clone, features swapped)

GOAL
- Use GrantGenie v3 as the base. Keep its UI layout, theme toggle, color system, button styles, spacing, and export utilities.
- Replace all grant-specific content with Credit Commander content, assets, endpoints, and copy.
- Deliver a polished, mobile-first MVP with dark theme default.

KEEP (from GrantGenie)
- App shell + header layout + gradient wash
- Theme toggle (light/dark), default = DARK
- Button component with glow hover/focus
- Card, input, textarea, select, tooltip components
- PDF & CSV export utilities
- localStorage save/load
- Usage limit middleware (counter + lockout UX)
- Footer: “Powered by YourBizGuru.com” + Privacy/Terms links

GLOBAL RENAME/SWAP
- App name: Credit Commander
- Tagline: Build business credit with AI-powered assistance
- Route/slug: /credit (if applicable)
- Icon: credit-card style (placeholder OK)
- Replace ALL “Grant Genie/GrantGenie/grant” strings with “Credit Commander/creditCommander/credit”
- Update meta: <title>, description, OpenGraph/Twitter

BRANDING (YBG)
- Colors (do NOT change names; just values):
  --primary: #4DB6E7 (YBG Light Blue)
  --accent:  #FFEB3B (YBG Yellow)  ← use for outlines, small glows
  --ink:     #111418 (dark text)
  --paper:   #0D1116 (dark bg) / #FAFBFD (light bg)
  --muted:   #8FA3B8
- Effects: keep subtle diagonal wash + soft outer glows on CTAs and KPI badges (accent glow).
- Default theme = DARK. Ensure toggle icon/moon matches other toolkits.

- Left: app icon + “Credit Commander”
- Right: Theme toggle (same component as GG)

CODE TASKS (high-level)
1) Duplicate GG project structure; rename app identifiers to creditCommander.

5) Update theme default to dark; keep toggle persistence.
6) Apply YBG colors; add accent glow class to primary buttons + KPI.
7) Replace favicon/app icon (credit card). Keep your <link rel="icon"> references.
8) Update footer links to YourBizGuru.com (open in new tab).
9) Ensure mobile layout matches GG breakpoints.
